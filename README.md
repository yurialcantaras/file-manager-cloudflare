## System Objective

The file management system allows users to upload and download files through a simple web interface. It uses PHP to handle file uploads and Cloudflare's CDN to enhance the performance and security of file delivery.

### Steps to Run the Project
1. *Environment Preparation*
- Ensure you have a web server configured (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP, or a remote web server with PHP support).
- Use a text editor to modify PHP and HTML files (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text).

2. *Server Configuration*
- Install the web server and place the project folder (file-manager) in the server's root directory (e.g., htdocs for XAMPP).

3. *Cloudflare Configuration* üåê
- Sign up on Cloudflare and add your domain.
- Update your domain's DNS records to point to your web server.
- In the Cloudflare dashboard, configure the following:
 + Page Rules: Add a cache rule for yourdomain.com/files/* and select "Cache Everything".
 + SSL/TLS: Enable "Always Use HTTPS".
 + Speed: Enable minification for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

4. *Running the System* üöÄ
- Start the web server.
- Open a browser and access the system via your server's URL (e.g., http://localhost/file-manager or your configured domain).
- Use the web interface to upload files.
- Uploaded files will be listed on the main page and available for download.

5. *Testing Cloudflare Integration* ‚úÖ
- After uploading files, check if they are delivered via Cloudflare's CDN by accessing the download links.
- Monitor Cloudflare's dashboard for cache and performance statistics.
